# Apex-Weather-Dashboard

## Description

Apex Weather Dashboard is a simple weather application that will show the current weather conditions for whichever city a user enters into the input bar. It also shows a 5 day forecast for the searched city and saves recent searches to local storage and generates a button to easily search again.

## Usage

To search a city, the user will simply slick into the input box, type their desired city and click the button. This will generate current conditions and 5 day forecast for that city.

Upon searching a city, that city name will be saved into client side storage as well as a button that is rendered to the left side of the page. This makes for easy access for the user to re-search previously searched cities.
